  <p> Knottwood Montessori Daycare & OSC has an open door policy and learning through play is the base of our program. Learning through play provides the children opportunities to grow and enhance their creative, intellectual, social, physical and emotional development. We strive to foster a positive self-image and respect for all the children and adults.

Building positive relationships is the core of our practice. Families play the most important role in children’s lives.  We believe keeping open communication with families is important for the optimal care of the children.

Our routine is balanced between independent times and teacher directed times to allow children to freely and comfortably decide on the activities they wish to pursue as well as time to learn in group settings. </p>

We believe children are entitled to environments and opportunities that foster positive growth while being treated with dignity and respect. We recognize that play is a child’s response to life and the medium through which he/she learns, and we therefore employ this principle in our day-to-day activities

Montessori is a type of program for teaching children that was developed by Italian physician and educator Maria Montessori at the beginning of the 20th century. It stresses a child’s independence, freedom within limits, and respects the child’s psychological, physical, and social development. Maria Montessori understood that a child’s first few years are vital to their future development and that it is a time frame when they are the most curious and can easily absorb new concepts and information. Because each child is unique, instruction in a Montessori program is individualized and education is regarded as a process of continually cultivating the child’s natural desire to learn. Our program emphasizes the following:</p>
